However, their tentative conclusion that macroscopic neocortex may be considered (approximately) a linear near-equilibrium system is premature and does not correspond to tentative conclusions drawn from other studies of neocortex. At this time, there exists an interdisciplinary multidimensional gradation on published studies of neocortex, with one primary dimension of mathematical physics represented by two extremes. At one extreme, there is much scientifically unsupported talk of chaos and quantum physics being responsible for many important macroscopic neocortical processes (involving many thousands to millions of neurons) (Wilczek, 1994). At another extreme, many non-mathematically trained neuroscientists uncritically lump all neocortical mathematical theory into one file, and consider only statistical averages of citations for opinions on the quality of that research (Nunez, 1995). In this context, it is important to appreciate that Wright and Liley (W&L) report on their scientifically sound studies on macroscopic neocortical function, based on simulation and a blend of sound theory and reproducible experiments. However, their pioneering work, given the absence of much knowledge of neocortex at this time, is open to criticism, especially with respect to their present inferences and conclusions. Their
