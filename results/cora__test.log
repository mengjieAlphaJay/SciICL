Abstract: Abstract: The work in progress reported by Wright & Liley shows great promise, primarily because of their experimental and simulation paradigms. However, their tentative conclusion that macroscopic neocortex may be considered (approximately) a linear near-equilibrium system is premature and does not correspond to tentative conclusions drawn from other studies of neocortex. At this time, there exists an interdisciplinary multidimensional gradation on published studies of neocortex, with one primary dimension of mathematical physics represented by two extremes. At one extreme, there is much scientifically unsupported talk of chaos and quantum physics being responsible for many important macroscopic neocortical processes (involving many thousands to millions of neurons) (Wilczek, 1994). At another extreme, many non-mathematically trained neuroscientists uncritically lump all neocortical mathematical theory into one file, and consider only statistical averages of citations for opinions on the quality of that research (Nunez, 1995). In this context, it is important to appreciate that Wright and Liley (W&L) report on their scientifically sound studies on macroscopic neocortical function, based on simulation and a blend of sound theory and reproducible experiments. However, their pioneering work, given the absence of much knowledge of neocortex at this time, is open to criticism, especially with respect to their present inferences and conclusions. Their conclusion that EEG data exhibit linear near-equilibrium dynamics may very well be true, but only in the sense of focusing only on one local minima, possibly with individual-specific and physiological-state dependent

Abstract: Abstract: A learning agent employing reinforcement learning is hindered because it only receives the critic's sparse and weakly informative training information. We present an approach in which an automated training agent may also provide occasional instruction to the learner in the form of actions for the learner to perform. The learner has access to both the critic's feedback and the trainer's instruction. In the experiments, we vary the level of the trainer's interaction with the learner, from allowing the trainer to instruct the learner at almost every time step, to not allowing the trainer to respond at all. We also vary a parameter that controls how the learner incorporates the trainer's actions. The results show significant reductions in the average number of training trials necessary to learn to perform the task.

Abstract: Active learning differs from passive "learning from examples" in that the learning algorithm assumes at least some control over what part of the input domain it receives information about. In some situations, active learning is provably more powerful that learning from examples alone, giving better generalization for a fixed number of training examples. In this paper, we consider the pro

Abstract: Abstract: Two issues of an intelligent navigation robot have been addressed in this work. First is the robot's ability to learn a representation of the local environment and use this representation to identify which local environment it is in. This is done by first extracting features from the sensors which are more informative than just distances of obstacles in various directions. Using these features a reduced ring representation (RRR) of the local environment is derived. As the robot navigates, it learns the RRR signatures of all the new environment types it encounters. For purpose of identification, a ring matching criteria is proposed where the robot tries to match the RRR from the sensory input to one of the RRRs in its library. The second issue addressed is that of learning hill climbing control laws in the local environments. Unlike conventional neuro-controllers, a reinforcement learning framework, where the robot first learns a model of the environment and then learns the control law in terms of a neural network is proposed here. The reinforcement function is generated from the sensory inputs of the robot before and after a control action is taken. Three key results shown in this work are that (1) The robot is able to build its library of RRR signatures perfectly even with significant sensor noise for eight different local environ-mets, (2) It was able to identify its local environment with an accuracy of more than 96%, once the library is build, and (3) the robot was able to learn adequate hill climbing control laws which take it to the distinctive state of the local environment for five different environment types.
